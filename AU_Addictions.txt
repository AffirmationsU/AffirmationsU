I receive the energy to free my body from addiction
A dose of prayer, a tablet of support, and an injection of positive energy keep me on the road to recovery
The more I take care of myself, the better I feel
I can always resist something if I choose to
I lovingly do everything I can to assist my body in maintaining perfect health
I am constantly discovering new ways to improve my health
I am pain free and totally in sync with life
I forgive myself for not treating my body well in the past
I am healthier than i have ever been
My body loves to be healthy
