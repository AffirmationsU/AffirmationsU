I am creating opportunities for myself
I am worthy of great success
Each simple, completed task propels me towards success
I welcome change in my career, attitude, behavior, and lifestyle
I have well-structured goals and stick to my deadlines
My income is constantly increasing
I know that when I do my best at my job, I will be rewarded in all sorts of ways
The perfect job is looking for me, and we are being brought together now
I am creating a good feeling at work 
When it is time for a new job, the perfect position presents itself easily
I now do work I love, and I am well paid for it
