Today, no person, place, or thing can irritate or annoy me I choose to be at peace
As I forgive myself, it becomes easier to forgive others
I am comfortable looking in the mirror, saying, “I love you, I really love you”
I am willing to let go
My day begins and ends with gratitude
I am forgiving myself for not being perfect
I choose to see clearly with the eyes of love
I release all drama from my life
I forgive everyone in my past for all perceived wrongs I release them with love
I am at peace
