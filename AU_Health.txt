I let go of all negativity that rests in my body and mind
I am the only person who has control over my eating habits 
I lovingly do everything I can to assist my body in maintaining perfect health
I get plenty of sleep every night My body appreciates how I take care of it
I am constantly discovering new ways to improve my health
Filling my mind with pleasant thoughts is the quickest road to health
I am grateful for my healthy body I love life
My happy thoughts help create my healthy body
My life gets more fabulous every day I look forward to what each new hour brings
I am a radiant being, enjoying life to the fullest
