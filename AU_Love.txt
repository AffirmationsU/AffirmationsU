I draw love and romance into my life, and I accept it now
I am safe in all my relationships, and I give and receive lots of love
I am rejoicing in the love i encounter every day
I am feeling safe with those who are like me and those who are different from me
I happily give and receive love each day
I attract loving and caring people into my life
I am with the love of my life We both treat each other with respect
I attract loving and caring people into my life
Wherever I go and whoever I am with, I find love
I open my heart to love and know that I deserve it
