I am a magnet for money Prosperity of every kind is drawn to me
Today is a delightful day Money comes to me in expected and unexpected ways
I move from poverty thinking to prosperity thinking and my finances reflect this change
I delight in the financial security that is a constant in my life
I am open and receptive to all the wealth in the Universe
I am open and receptive to new avenues of income
I now receive my good from expected and unexpected sources
I am an individual being accepting from an unlimited source in an unlimited way
Life supports me in every possible way
There is plenty for everyone, including me
