I let go of others opinions of me It does not matter what they think
I have the ability to expand my comfort zone slowly and consistently
My reaction to every obstacle is positive
I dare to be different Positive people dare to be different I am a positive person
I surround myself with positive people, just like me
The greatest gift I can give myself is unconditional love
I trust myself
I am receiving the best that life has to offer now
I know that I can create miracles in my life
The Law of Attraction brings only good into my life
