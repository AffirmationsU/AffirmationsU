I give myself permission to be calm.
I enjoy being me!
I open myself to experience all feelings.
I have an attitude of gratitude.
I am walking in the shoes of the person I want to become.
I am a beautiful work in progress.
I am releasing all criticism.
It is now safe for me to release all of my childhood traumas and move into love.
I am a unique gift to the world.
I have unlimited potential. Only good lies before me.
